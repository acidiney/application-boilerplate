# Application Boilerplate
It's an implementation of clean architecture with nestjs.

## Warning ⚠️
Maybe changes can happen in this repo.

## Why this repo?
A couple of months ago, I started learning about clean architecture, and how I can use it in my projects.

The concept of C.A is fascinating, and I already see the benefits of implementing this architecture in projects.
But, one thing that I can't accept is the fact of ignore all work that a lot of engineers around word already made. 
And start everything from beginning. **(Maybe I'm wrong, and it's the best choice)**

Nestjs is a great framework to work with nodejs backend application, is flexible to use common rest application, or other kind of application
In my investigations I found a  lot of interesting implementations of C.A in Nestjs, but, all that implementations, feel to my too much coupled to nestjs
In this boilerplate nestjs lives only in framework folder, inside main folder.

And yes, I lose too much of nestjs, but I gain flexibility to change it if, it's not interesting anymore.

### Technologies
